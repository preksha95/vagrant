AT NFS SERVER node:
Bring up a VM with lots of hard disk (in TBs)
and minimum cpu and ram (2 cores, 8 gb)

install NFS server on this VM, follow below steps:

-->install the nfs server package
apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

-->Let's say we want to SHARE a directory in this VM /home/apcuser/demofolder ,
#sudo mkdir -p /export/apcuser_demofolder
It's important that /export and /export/apcuser_demofolder have 777 permissions as we will be accessing the 
sudo chmod 777 -R /export
sudo chmod 777 -R /export/apcuser_demofolder

-->NFS share from the client without LDAP/NIS authentication. 
#sudo  mount --bind /home/apcuser/demofolder /export/apcuser_demofolder


-->To save us from retyping this after every reboot we add the following
line to /etc/fstab
 /home/apcuser/demofolder   /export/apcuser_demofolder   none    bind  0  0

-->To export our directories to a local network 192.168.125.123/24 we add the following two lines to /etc/exports
/export       192.168.125.123/24(rw,fsid=0,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)
/export/apcuser_demofolder 192.168.125.123/24(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check,async)

-->Now add the following line to /etc/hosts.allow:
rpcbind mountd nfsd statd lockd rquotad : 192.168.125.123 127.0.0.1
Note: Ensure that the list of authorised IP addresses includes the localhost address (127.0.0.1) as the startup scripts in 
recent versions of Ubuntu use the rpcinfo command to discover NFSv3 support, 
and this will be disabled if localhost is unable to connect.


-->Now restart the service
# service nfs-kernel-server restart



at NFS CLIENT NODE (192.168.125.123):
any vm present in nfs server's network  can be a nfs client
-->Install the required packages:
#sudo apt-get install nfs-common 
-->Now  mount it.
# sudo mount -t nfs -o proto=tcp,port=2049 <nfs-server-IPAddress>:/export/apcuser_demofolder /home/apcuser/demo_nfs_sharing_demofolder

-->To save us from retyping this after every reboot we add the following line to /etc/fstab:
<nfs-server-IP>:/   /mnt   nfs    auto  0  0
If after mounting, the entry in /proc/mounts appears as <nfs-server-IP>:// (with two slashes), then you might need to 
specify two slashes in /etc/fstab, or else umount might complain that it cannot find the mount.
The auto option mounts on startup.However this will not work if your client uses a wifi connection managed at the user 
level (after login), because the network will not be available at boot time. In Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and later, 
wifi connections are managed at the system level by default, so auto-mounting of NFS shares at boot time should work fine.
Ubuntu Server doesn't come with any init.d/netfs or other scripts to do this for you.

-->Now add the following line to /etc/hosts.allow:
rpcbind : NFS server IP address
